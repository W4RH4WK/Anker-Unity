  _Title: Sherlock Holmes
  _Body: To Sherlock Holmes she is always <i>the</i> woman.| I have seldom heard
    him mention her under any other name.| In his eyes she eclipses and predominates
    the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene
    Adler.| All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold,
    precise but admirably balanced mind.
